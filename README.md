# RubiksCubeSolver
A Visual Rubiks Cube Solver

This is a practice personal project to improve my development skills and a learning opportunity. This is my first project working with Unity3D and MonoDevelop. I am also utilizing Unity Test Tools for Unit Testing purposes. 

The solving method is utilizing the Layer Method as described in detail here:

# Things To Consider!

* Color.Magenta is being used for the orange side of the rubiks cube because Color.Orange is not built into Unity. It still works just the same using that color though.

* The "clockwise" direction is ALWAYS in coordination with looking AT the face. For example, rotating the bottom face clockwise is the opposite direction of rotating the top face clockwise. 

# Controls

* Left/Right to rotate to the left or right

* Up/Down will move between the rows

* Q/A rotates left forward/backwards

* W/S rotates middle forward/backwards

* E/D rotates right forward/backwards

* N/B rotates front clockwise/counter clockwise

* H/G rotates middle clockwise/counter clockwise

* T/Y rotates back clockwise/counter clockwise
