# RubiksCubeSolver
A Visual Rubiks Cube Solver

This is a practice personal project to improve my development skills and a learning opportunity. This is my first project working with Unity3D and MonoDevelop. I am also utilizing Unity Test Tools for Unit Testing purposes. 

The solving method is utilizing the Layer Method as described in detail here: http://www.wikihow.com/Solve-a-Rubik%27s-Cube-with-the-Layer-Method

# Things To Consider!

* Color.Magenta is being used for the orange side of the rubiks cube because Color.Orange is not built into Unity. It still works just the same using that color though.

* The "clockwise" direction is ALWAYS in coordination with looking AT the face. For example, rotating the bottom face clockwise is the opposite direction of rotating the top face clockwise.
